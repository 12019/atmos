Compile:

 cd src
 editor config.h   (enable/disable build options)
 editor Makefile   ($ARCH)
 editor eedata.S   (can change EEPROM data loaded on card, such as
                   serial number, rng seed, keys or file permissions)

 make              (result are sosse.{bin,hex} and eedata.{bin,hex})

Loading onto smartcard:

 sosse.bin or .hex  -> Flash
 eedata.bin or .hex -> internal EEPROM


SOSSE is documented inside the source. Printable/browsable documentation
is generated with doxygen. A "make" in the top level directory will
also build the documentation. If you do not have doxygen installed and
do not want to install it, you find the most important documentation in
"src/main.h". You can also browse it online at:
